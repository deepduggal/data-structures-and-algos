# Description
An array is a data structure that stores a sequence of elements.

Strings are an important type of array.

A closely related idea is a contiguous block of memory.

# Types of Arrays

1. Static Array: This is the simplest type of array. It has a fixed size, which is set at the time of creation. The size cannot be changed after the array is created.

2. Dynamic Array: This type of array can change its size during the execution of the program. It automatically resizes itself when elements are added or removed. Examples include JavaScript's Array object, Python's list, and Java's ArrayList.

3. Multi-Dimensional Array: This is an array of arrays. The most common example is a 2D array, which can be thought of as a grid with rows and columns.

4. Jagged Array (or Ragged Array): This is a type of multi-dimensional array where each "row" can have a different number of "columns". In other words, it's an array of arrays, but the inner arrays can be of different lengths.

5. Associative Array: This is an array that uses strings instead of numeric indices. It maps keys to values, similar to a dictionary or a map. In JavaScript, objects can be used as associative arrays.

6. Sparse Array: This is an array in which most of the elements have a default value (usually null or 0). Sparse arrays are used when you have a large array with only a few non-default values to save memory.

7. Circular Array: This is a type of linear data structure in which the last element points to the first element making a circular loop. It is used in problems dealing with circular conditions like a circular queue.

8. Parallel Array: In this structure, multiple arrays are used to store data that is related. Each element at a particular index in each array corresponds to the elements at the same index in the other arrays.
