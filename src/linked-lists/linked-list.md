# Description

A linked list is a linear data structure consisting of nodes, where each node contains a value and a reference (or link) to the next node in the list. It allows for efficient insertion and deletion operations at any position in the list, but accessing elements by index requires traversing the list from the beginning.

# Types of Linked Lists
There are several types of linked lists, including:

- Singly Linked List: Each node has a reference to the next node in the list.
- Doubly Linked List: Each node has references to both the next and previous nodes in the list.
- Circular Linked List: The last node in the list has a reference to the first node, creating a circular structure.
